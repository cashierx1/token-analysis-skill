# Investment Playbook

Distilled decision frameworks for early-stage crypto token analysis. These aren't summaries — they're decision rules.

## 1. The Metagame

Bull-market crypto is a video game with an evolving meta. Knowing the current meta gives you maximum edge.

**Rules:**
- **Identify the current meta.** What category is the hot-ball-of-money rotating into? Name it explicitly.
- **Understand WHY.** A meta rooted in a real problem is durable. A meta rooted in mimetic exuberance burns fast.
- **Metagames have a lifecycle:** investment thesis → popularity → mimetic exuberance. Buy in thesis phase, sell in exuberance.
- **The biggest losers misidentify a metagame as a long-term thesis.** They turn a trade into a church.
- **Counter-metas exist.** When a meta is dominant, look for what responds well to it — that's the next rotation.

## 2. Attention Theory of Value

The only scarce resource in crypto is attention. Price = f(attention) on trader timescales.

**Rules:**
- **Track the attention lifecycle:**
  - Niche → becoming favoured (BUY HERE)
  - Becoming favoured → saturated (attention peaks, ownership catches up)
  - Saturated → bagholders only (SELL BEFORE THIS)
- **Ownership catches up to attention.** Once everyone who would buy has bought, the only remaining attention is from holders. Price stalls.
- **"Becoming favoured" = maximum opportunity.** Buy the transition, not the destination.
- **Community = sustained attention.** Products with real users create organic, sustained attention.

## 3. Probabilistic Thinking

You can't see the future. You can estimate probabilities across possible futures and find trades where the math is in your favour.

**Rules:**
- **For every position, enumerate 3-5 scenarios** with rough probabilities.
- **Calculate expected value.** 80% chance of +3x and 20% chance of -50% = great trade. 50/50 on +20%/-80% = terrible.
- **Asymmetric risk/reward is everything.** Large + likely upside, small + unlikely downside.
- **Your exit plan IS your thesis.** Before entering: at what price/event do you sell in the bull case? At what price/event do you cut losses?
- **Re-evaluate as new information arrives.** Probabilities change.

## 4. Market Caps, FDV & Unlocks

*Source: Cobie, "On the Meme of Market Caps & Unlocks"*

Market cap measures demand. FDV measures supply. They are different things.

**Rules:**
- **Know who holds locked tokens and their cost basis.** Seed investors at 100x with tokens unlocking next month = sell pressure wall.
- **90-95% of unlocks are bearish.** Default assumption.
- **Small float + high FDV = danger.** Tiny public demand creates enormous paper valuations.
- **Compare BOTH market cap and FDV to peers.**

## 5. Incentive Mapping

*Source: Cobie, "(3,3)" + "Incentives Structures"*

"Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome."

**Rules:**
- **Identify ALL participants:** team, seed investors, VCs, market makers, retail, community, airdrop recipients. Know their cost basis, lock schedule, motivations.
- **Time horizon reveals everything.** Long-term players protect reputation. Short-term players extract value.
- **Presale structures predict charts.** Seed at 1/50th of IDO price with short vesting → chart goes down.
- **Verify onchain:** Is the team staking? Are VCs holding? Has the deployer wallet been selling?

---

## 6. Social Graph as Distribution

A dev's social graph is a leading indicator of holder quality and distribution.

**Rules:**
- **The dev's followers ARE the initial distribution.** Quality of graph = quality of holders.
- **Weight followers by onchain activity, not count.** 50 active deployers > 5,000 dormant accounts.
- **Engagement quality > volume.** Builders in the replies = real signal. "LFG 🚀" accounts = noise.
- **Graph age matters.** A 14-year account with organic connections cannot be faked.

---

## 7. Fair Launch Advantage

*Source: Cobie, "New Launches Part 1"*

Increasingly, all returns are captured privately before launch. Fair launches (Clanker, pump.fun style) reverse this — no seed round capturing 100x before you.

**Rules:**
- **Compare launch FDV to comparable projects at comparable market conditions.**
- **Fair launches = structural edge.** No VCs at 1/50th of your price, no cliff unlocks creating sell pressure.
- **Early access to fair launches is the game.** Everyone starts at roughly the same level.

---

## 8. Combined Framework

```
1. WHAT META?        → Identify the current narrative/category
2. WHERE IN LIFECYCLE? → Thesis / Popularity / Exuberance
3. ATTENTION STATE?  → Niche→Popular (buy) or Popular→Saturated (sell)
4. WHO IS THE DEV?   → Incentives, time horizon, social graph
5. STRUCTURE?        → Float, FDV, unlocks, fair launch or VC dump
6. SCENARIOS?        → 3-5 futures with probabilities
7. RISK/REWARD?      → Expected value, position sizing
8. EXIT PLAN?        → When to sell in each scenario
```

If any step returns a red flag, skip the trade. The cost of passing is zero.

---

## 9. Position Sizing

Size gradually: starter → conviction → full. Don't ape full size on initial signal. Take a starter to get skin in the game, then size up as the thesis plays out.

## 10. Think in Categories

When a category heats up, multiple plays exist within it. Track the category, not just one token. If the category thesis is right, you get multiple shots on goal.

## 11. Post-Mortem Everything

Track wins and losses, and why. Every outcome should sharpen the model.
